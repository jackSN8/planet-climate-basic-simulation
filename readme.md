This is a openframeworks based planet climate simulator. The goal is to be able to procedurally generate planets and then perform long term climate simulations on them. 
It is also meant to be somewhat cheesy, and likely not that accurate, more of a fun widget. I would like to use it on Mars and Titan to see what terraforming
does to them.
